# **Dataset Explorer Function (Powerful)**

Dataset Explorer is a Python script that allows you to analyze and explore datasets in various file formats such as CSV, XLSX, and JSON. It provides information about the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and displays the dataset's head, tail, and a sample of rows.
```python
                                                 ALL IN ONE VIEW!!!
```

# Prerequisites ðŸ’»

To run the this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code Editor

Packages

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import display, HTML
```

# Getting Started ðŸ› 

To run the Python files in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.
3. Place your Dataset (csv, xlsx, json) in the project directory.
4. Execute the Jupyter Notebook

# Data Exploration ðŸ”‘

**Data exploration is an essential step in understanding the dataset before performing in-depth analysis. Dataset Explorer offers the following features for data exploration:.** 500K Tweets for period Jan - Mar 2023 on "ChatGPT" sourced from Kaggle.com was used. Areas Explored:
1. Dataset Information (Meta data)
2. Colunm Information (Error Finding, Missing Values)
3. Dataset Views (Familiarity Gained)

# Exploatory Analysis ðŸ”¬

The large dataframe was explored through descriptive statistacal analysis; shape, datatypes, max, min, mean, count, NULL values check, NA values check, Unique values check, Duplicates check, whitespace characters, break line characters, special characters (r'!?-\|:;#@()+-="{}[]*$%^&â‚¬Â£/~`'). Head, Tail, Sample functions were also used to explore snippets of the dataset to gain better understanding and develop familiariarity to dataset columns and content.

# Data Cleaning ðŸ§¼

Now that the Dataset has been explored, python can be used to clean unstructured, messy data and fix errors and estimate missing values.

# Files

The following files were used in this project:

- README.md: Description file outlining the project
- Dataset_Explorerin.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for exploring and analysing large datasets
- Tweets_Chatgpt_2023.csv: The raw data file of 500,000 tweets


# Conclusion

By combining data exploration and analysis, Dataset Explorer provides a convenient and efficient way to understand and analyze datasets, helping users make data-driven decisions and extract meaningful insights.
